# Toms-Tire-Analysis
Simple overlay to get a look at the tire data when in the pits.  Useful when working on setups.


This is a little display to show your tire data when in the pits.  It does not give you live data while on track.  This is useful when you are working on your setups.

As usual, unzip file and move the unzipped folder into the C:\Program Files (x86)\SimHub\DashTemplates directory.
